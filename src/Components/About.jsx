      <p className="opacity-70">
        My journey started with learning C# and Unity. I have been always
        interested in programming but I did not get a heavy focus on programming
        during my university. I looked into web development and got enthusiastic
        on discovering new programming languages and exploring the world of web
        technology.

        Started my learning path in frontend development and stumbled on a great
        platform called frontendmentor.io and my web development challenges
        began. I have been actively learning and practicing real world projects
        with a great community to learn from. I am a passionate highly motivated
        frontend developer, eager to create seamless user experience and
        visually appealing websites and I am keen on maintaining a clean,
        reusable code with industry best practices.
