        I am Mazen. My journey started with learning C# and Unity. I have been
        always interested in programming but I did not get a heavy focus on
        programming during my university. I looked into web development and got
        enthusiastic on discovering new programming languages and exploring the
        world of web technology.
      </p>

      <p className="opacity-70">
        Started my learning path in frontend development and stumbled on a great
        platform called frontendmentor.io and my web development challenges
        began. I have been actively learning and practicing real world projects
        with a great community to learn from. I am a passionate highly motivated
        frontend developer, eager to create seamless user experience and
        visually appealing websites and I am keen on maintaining a clean,
        reusable code with industry best practices.
